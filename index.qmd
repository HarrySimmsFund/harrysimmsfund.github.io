The Harry Simms Fund is a Kentucky-based 501(c)(3) organization that is dedicated to teaching the history and present of the struggle for workers' rights in our Commonwealth.

We are an all-volunteer organization looking to tell the stories of average Kentucky workers standing up for their rights, both in the past and today.

Do you have a story that others need to hear? Is there a particular area of labor history you're interested in? [Share it with us](mailto:info@harrysimmsfund.org) and we'll help spread the word.
